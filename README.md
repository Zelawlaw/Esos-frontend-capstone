## PROJECT NAME

Safaricom eSOS application.

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The team has created an Emergency case Report Application Portal.
The primary objective of this Application Portal is to ensure that all health or security emergencies as reported are captured, tracked and updated until incident is closed.
The Application Portal will also ensure that the staff member reporting line is also notified and updated.

Incase of a health or security emergency, Safaricom staff are currently required to call the Security Control Room for help. As a reporter, the staff has no way of tracking their incident i.e., checking on how long the help will arrive or checking on any updates regarding their report.
The staffâ€™s reporting line are also not made aware of the incident affecting them unless the staff member makes multiple calls to inform them.

## MVPs

Landing page which has a login form with the ability to sign in the user. 
Main Dashboard with a view of all incidents.
A form to log in new incidents, update and close once resolved.
Implementation of a hierarchy structure i.e., visibility by line manager of incidences reported by staff members under them.
User role differentials-The Portal to have user roles i.e., Administrator and user. Administrator has access to all features, while Manager has access to their team's data and Employee has access to their own data.


## BDD

on the main dashboard user has access to variuos functionalities depending on role

All users have a view of all their reported cases and those of direct reports depending on your role.
